<h2>Ep II, Part I — Nick</h2>

<p><a href=“#”>one</a></p>

<p>“What do you mean, ‘too bad they’re fake’?” The kid asks him, in that wide-eyed way that means he’s considering what Nick has to say, no matter how mind blowing it is.</p>

<p>Nick hasn’t seen that reaction in a very long time. No one has been willing to buy a fucking word he’s said in twenty years. It sobers him up a bit.</p>

<p>Nick stops mumbling and looks at the kid sitting next to him. Maybe this one isn’t such an idiot.</p>

<p>He realizes he has no idea what he’s said, or what the kid is asking about. He’s been weaving back and forth across the very edge of total drunken stupor for a while now, swimming through the boozy warmth where he prefers to spend his nights. </p>

<p>Since Darla left. </p>

<p>And took the goddamned dog with her.</p>

<p><em>Had to go, she said. Still loves me, she said.</em></p>

<p><em>Okay, fine</em>, thinks Nick. <em>But the dog? What in freakin’ hell is a dog gonna do in space?</em></p>

<p>“Nick?”</p>

<p>Nick realizes he’s been staring dumbly at the kid. </p>

<p>“I’m here,” Nick confirms.</p>

<p>He uses the back of his hand to wipe a little escaped drool off his chin, and spots the bottle in his hand as he does so. He goes to take a swig, but finds the bottle empty. It must be later than he thought.</p>

<p>“What did you mean about the stars?” the kid persists.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” <em>Jesus Christ. What the fuck did I say do this little idiot?</em></p>

<p>“When I said the stars were beautiful, you said ‘too bad they’re fake’? What do you mean?” the kid asks him, really sounding disturbed. Like maybe it’s possible that everything he has ever learned is wrong, just because drunken old Nick Swift says so.</p>

<p><em>Ah the young!</em> thinks Nick. <em>So defenseless.</em></p>

<p>“I mean, you’ve been ... up there ... right?” </p>

<p>Nick sits up, shakes his head to clear it.</p>

<p>“Yeah. So, what if I told you the entire solar system almost got sucked into a cosmic sewer because some malfunctioning alien sex robot pulled the wrong lever on a giant space toilet, would you believe that too?” Nick asks him, watching the kid’s reaction with bleary interest.</p>

<p>“Haha. Ha ... wait, are you serious?” The kid’s eyes are wide behind thick glasses.</p>

<p>“Who the hell are you, kid?” Nick asks, disregarding the his question.</p>

<p>“I’m Moe’s nephew, Carl.”</p>

<p>“Ah right! Carl!” Nick says with a nod of recognition. “You got ... hairier,” he adds, taking in the kid’s long locks and bushy beard. “Are you a hippie or something?”</p>

<p>“I guess,” says Carl with a shrug.</p>

<p>“Cool,” says Nick, and tries to hand him the empty bottle. Carl smiles and waves it away.</p>

<p>“Where’s your aunt?”</p>

<p>“She’s over in the yard. Checking out that ... thing you found.”</p>

<p>Nick’s memory begins to fall back together as the boozy fog slowly clears.</p>

<p><em>Shit! The pod!</em></p>

<p>Nick stands up suddenly, and might have pitched forward onto his face but for Carl’s quick snatch of the back collar of his jacket.</p>

<p>“Well done, kid, thanks. I think I can make it on my from here,” Nick mumbles, staggering a bit as he finds his feet.</p>

<p>Carl, embarrassed, releases Nick’s jacket.</p>

<p>“The pod!” Nick repeats, aloud.</p>

<p>“What is it? Some kind of vehicle?” Carl asks, eyes shining.</p>

<p>“Kid. Do yourself a favor and stay out of it,” Nick tells him, “why are you even here?”</p>

<p>“Moe called me.”</p>

<p>“What the hell for? No offense.”</p>

<p>“Well, you were passed out, and she needed a hand.”</p>

<p>“So Moe thought you could help us out with our little UFO, huh?”</p>

<p>“So it <em>is</em> from space!? What is it you want me to stay out of? Are we being attacked?? What did you mean about the stars being fake?”</p>

<p>“Kid,” Nick says with a sigh, “I’m drunk. I was making a joke. Calm the hell down, will ya?”</p>

<p>Carl looks suspiciously at Nick, but seems to calm down some.</p>

<p>“You know, I’m something of an expert on this myself,” Carl says after a short silence.</p>

<p>“How’s that?” Nick asks him.</p>

<p>“I <em>am</em> an astrophysicist!” Carl offers.</p>

<p>“No shit!” Nick says with a drunken guffaw. “Well, how the hell could you possibly know anything about space if you’ve never been there?”</p>
