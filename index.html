<h1>Episode II: Ray Runs the Gauntlet</h1>

<h2>Part II: Ladon</h2>

<h3>1</h3>

<p><a href="#one">one</a></p>

<p>The surface of the flight deck is about five meters below her. Ray finds a very convenient grapple and line on the pilfered Dominion guard belt, and lowers herself slowly to the deck, keeping an eye out for anything sneaking up as she dangles in midair for several seconds, completely exposed.</p>

<p>Ray takes a deep breath as she descends, eyeing the bridge complex at the bow of the ship. Just a hop, skip, and a jump away, she thinks. And her path looks clear — all she has to do now is keep her head down, and haul ass.</p>

<p>She hits the deck running.</p>

<p>She passes a small group of Dominion soldiers who appear to be regrouping after a severe defeat, and are too compromised to do anything but strike a defensive posture at Ray’s passing, staring at her in clear amazement. Perhaps half a dozen wounded men, she could easily dispatch the pitiful group, but Ray, glancing at her chronometer, decides that discretion is the better part of valor, and continues on toward the bridge.</p>

<p><em>No pot-shots at the nice jogger, now, boys. Just passing by!</em> Ray thinks, resisting the urge to break into a sprint, doing her best not to pique their predatory interest. But they are far too distracted by their own misery to do more than stare at her in astonished alarm.</p>

<p><em>Zombie misery</em>, Ray reminds herself.</p>

<p>The sounds of battle are still distant, but growing louder, and coming from several directions. She’s almost certain to run into some kind of action out here.</p>

<p>Almost before she sees them, Ray runs up on a force of Empyrean soldiers — a full regiment from the look of it, clearly preparing to engage with some opposition — marching from the direction of the bridge. They are directly in her way, and Ray has no choice but to turn and cut across the line, trying to flank them before they reach her — she is not ready to try that bullet-catching trick again.</p>

<p>As she sprints along the line of soldiers — keeping her ears pricked for the sounds of rail-gun fire — Ray sees a group of half a dozen of them further ahead break off to intercept her. She’s not going to be able to avoid facing them — she can either fight, or retreat back across the flight deck. Ray stops running.</p>

<p>“Get the girl!” she hears over the din of Empyrean boots against the rough metal of the flight deck. Ray sees two of the soldiers closest to her split from the group and head in her direction. She smiles.</p>

<p><em>That’s right, boys. Come get me.</em></p>

<p>Although she&#39;s not keen on getting captured, Ray is happy that they’ve decided not to simply shoot her down, and she doesn’t want to start a firefight with a regiment of armed soldiers — so she leaves her rail-gun holstered and draws the looted elite guard’s sword from her belt. As before, the meta-plasm of her arm quickly oozes across the hilt and down the blade, coating the entire weapon in a shimmering membrane. And as before, Ray immediately feels the sword as an extension of her own body.</p>

<p>Though their faces are hidden by heavy metal helmets, Ray can see her two would-be captors hesitate in their approach.</p>

<p><em>Not something they’re used to seeing</em>, she thinks with a smile.</p>

<p>Ray swings her sword a few times, leaving fiery arcs in the air. She tries to look like she knows what she’s doing. </p>

<p><em>All I have to do is hit them with it</em>. Easy enough.</p>

<p>The soldiers stop their advance just out of range of her swings, draw their own swords, and strike identical fighting stances.</p>

<p>“Oh, <em>yeah!</em>” Ray says with a grin, “<em>sword fight!</em>”</p>

<p>The two soldiers are still gearing up for a possible scuffle with this little Earthling, when Ray leaps onto them, bearing down on them with such surprising fury that the first soldier barely has time to raise his weapon in defense. It does him no good, however — Ray’s meta-plasm–powered sword cuts through his blade, his neck and part of his shoulder, passing cleanly out the back of his body. The soldier collapses, both pieces of him spurting oily gore.</p>

<p>The second soldier’s scream of horror is muffled by his mask. He backs quickly away from Ray, dropping his sword and drawing his rail-gun. Several similar proclamations of horror and outrage erupt throughout the battalion who have just witnessed the brutal slaughter of their comrade. Ray hears many rail-guns being drawn.</p>

<p>“Not <em>much</em> of a sword fight,” Ray says. </p>

<p>Several of the soldiers level their weapons at her, and Ray does her best to pretend she might be able to fend off a few dozen plasma bolts at once, when she suddenly hears a sound over all the rest of the commotion on the deck that makes her almost wish they would all just pull their triggers.</p>

<h3>2</h3>

<p>&quot;STOP!&quot; comes a bellow over the crowd.</p>

<p>It is rough and rattling-wet, and as deep as the call of a bull elephant, the ‘ah’ sound a long and thunderous belch.</p>

<p>Ray is nearly overcome by an urge to run.</p>

<p>“I’ll give you a proper fight, monkey!” Ladon croaks as he stomps through the quickly parting crowd of Empyrean soldiers who, despite their great height, appear as children next to Ladon’s monstrous bulk. The heavy metal armor that he wears makes him appear even more massive. Ray can see that his armor is fully sealed — it’s going to be very difficult to get through. Luckily, she’s got a secret weapon. She just hopes she gets a chance to use it.</p>

<p>“Fuck,” Ray says. For an instant she has the chilling feeling that everything is going just the way it did last time: straight to hell.</p>

<p>“Okay, frog-man,” she says with all the bravado she can muster, ”but where’s your sword? Can’t have a sword fight without a sword!” she calls to him, trying to sound confident despite the hammering in her chest. She glances around her, looking for possible routes of escape.</p>

<p>One of the Dominion officers steps forward with a ceremonious air, and offers Ladon his sword — which the beast-man takes between two fingers. Ladon scoffs and shatters the weapon with one hand, dropping the fragments to the deck. The officer scowls at this insult, but is quick to step back behind his men when Ladon’s gaze lingers on him.</p>

<p><em>Yikes,</em> thinks Ray, listening to the shattered steel hit the deck.</p>

<p>“I’ll take the handicap,” Ladon says in a rattling baritone, turning to face her.</p>

<p><em>If a frog could talk</em>, Ray thinks, <em>that’s exactly what it would sound like.</em></p>

<p>“Well, okay, but I think you’ve already got enough of a mental hand—” Ray starts to say.</p>

<p>Ladon leaps toward her before she can finish her quip, covering almost the entire distance between them in a single bound. Ray barely has time to quick-draw her rail-gun and open fire. She lands several shots that deflect harmlessly off Ladon’s armor, leaving not so much as a scratch. She can feel the deck shiver as Ladon lands hard just a few meters in front of her.</p>

<p>“Fuck,” she says again. <em>I can’t let him get near me!</em></p>

<p>Ladon leaps toward her again, and this time will land directly on her if she doesn’t evade. She darts away, nearly emptying the rail-gun at him as he hits the ground with a thunderous crash and spins toward her. She holsters the useless rail-gun, and raises her sword.</p>

<p><em>He’s too damn close!</em> she thinks.</p>

<p>He’s gotten her trapped up against the Dominion regiment. They move to surround her, while she continues doing her best to evade Ladon’s half-hearted attempts at clobbering her. The two of them are quickly encircled by a jeering crowd, and Ray realizes she’s got nowhere to run.</p>

<p>Ladon closes in, but without real fury. She can see he’s toying with her. She needs to try to put that to her advantage, take him off guard. He takes a few half-hearted swings at her, which she easily dodges and deflects with her blade.</p>

<p>After a few seconds of this cat and mouse, Ray decides to try to land a hit. She feints, easily evading his defense, and strikes a solid blow with her blade against the left shoulder of Ladon’s armor.</p>

<p>It&#39;s like hitting a brick wall, full strength, with an aluminum baseball bat — a sensation Ray happens to be familiar with. In this case, however, the shock is unexpected, and stuns her. As does the realization —</p>

<p><em>I can’t get though his armor.</em></p>

<p>Ladon stumbles back a step from the blow, but is otherwise little affected by it. He lets out a rattling belch that could be either annoyance or laughter. Ray has a moment to consider that his armor seems tailor-made to take her on — but this would mean that Dr. Zed not only expects her, but has prepared against her new-found power. She pushes this terrifying thought away.</p>

<p><em>Okay, so his armor is somehow meta-plasm–proof, or whatever</em>, she thinks. Ray realizes her only hope is to get his helmet off. </p>

<p>The strike she landed didn’t get through his armor, but it did stagger him a bit — she knows she can hurt him, she’s just going to have to do it the old fashioned way … sort of.</p>

<p>Ray sheaths her sword and puts up her fists.</p>

<p>Ladon croaks a deep laugh, as well, each one approximately the size and mass of a beachball filled with cement.</p>

<p>“Laugh it up, slime-ball,” Ray says, spitting on the deck and dancing like a boxer. <em>Just like Mama taught you, now</em>, she thinks — a little inside joke she has with herself, as she’s never met her parents.</p>

<p>Before she can make a move, Ladon barrels toward her with an ear-shattering bellow, arms spread wide as if he intends to smash her between his massive fists.</p>

<p>Ray crouches, left hand on the ground in front of her, right hand back, ready to swing. She focuses every ounce of her strength on her meta-plasm, willing it diamond-hard and stellar-hot. A blinding white light radiates from her arm like the sudden dawning of a white star, bathing the deck in brilliance.</p>

<p>Despite this dramatic display of cosmic power, Ladon does not hesitate in his mad charge toward her, the deck shaking with every titanic footfall.</p>

<p>She knows that timing is everything. She’s got to slip between those two massive fists before he has a chance to mash her between them, and bring her own fist up to the chin of his helmet — try to tear it free. If she can get his helmet off, maybe she can reach into his head and squish his brain.</p>

<p>Ray has just enough time to shudder at the thought of Ladon’s big, slimy frog brain in her hand before he is on her, swinging his fists downward toward her, certain to crush her to a pulp.</p>

<p>Ray, lithe and quick as a cat, lunges forward and brings her fist up with all her might under the chin of Ladon’s heavy metal helmet. Ray’s fist, leaving a streak of radiance like a shooting star, strikes Ladon on the chin with a thunderous crack, just as the creature’s own massive fists meet with crushing force in the very spot where Ray had been an instant before.</p>

<p>Ray feels something give — she feels the metal of Ladon’s armor tearing away. In the same moment she is aware of the force of the creature’s fists meeting behind her, a blow that would surely have pulverized her.</p>

<p>Ladon staggers backward, stunned by the force of one of the mightiest uppercuts in galactic history. The metal of his helmet has been rent like paper at the neck, jagged remnants forming a torn collar, the helmet itself nowhere to be seen. The watching Empyrean soldiers are quiet, and Ladon himself — perhaps for the first time in his long, long life — seems to have been struck dumb.</p>

<p>“Oh no,” Ray says, breaking the silence, “now we can see your face!”</p>

<p>And what a face it is.</p>

<p>Twice as wide as it is tall, Ladon’s massive head consists almost entirely of a broad, flat mouth that stretches literally from ear to ear—the ears themselves holes in the sides of his head. Ladon’s skin is lumpy and brown — more like a toad than a frog, Ray thinks. Yellow, lidless eyes, like the headlights of a Mack truck, stare blankly from under scaly, horn-like protrusions. Ray knows from her previous encounter with the beast, that there is a lot more going on behind that empty stare than one might think.</p>

<p>His big eyes never leaving Ray, Ladon’s thick, glistening pink tongue creeps out from between his broad, flat lips. Wiggling like a giant slug, it squirms up and carefully, almost lasciviously, licks each enormous eyeball in turn, before retreating back into the wide mouth with a slurp and a snap.</p>

<p>Ray’s lip curls in disgust. “You shouldn’t do that in public!” she shouts at the monster, drawing her sword. <em>No reason to get my hands dirty</em>, she thinks.</p>

<p>Ray starts to say something about teaching him manners, when Ladon’s lips part again and that lump of pink slug-like tongue erupts toward Ray quicker than she would have thought possible. </p>

<p>It shoots toward her, lightning fast — too fast for Ray to intercept with her blade. The sticky, heavy muscle strikes Ray hard on the throat and immediately wraps around her neck, yanking her toward Ladon’s yawning mouth with such incredible speed and force that Ray’s feet are torn from the deck.</p>

<p>With fractions of a second to act, Ray slashes downward with her sword, easily cleaving through the thick tissue. She tumbles hard to the deck, her neck still gripped in the severed end of Ladon’s tongue. As she struggles to free herself from the thick, sticky tentacle and draw breath, she hears Ladon’s deafening roar of pain and rage, and she knows she has moments to get on her feet before half a ton of frog-monster lands on her head.</p>

<p>The tongue wrapped around her neck finally loses strength, and Ray is able to pull it free. She tosses it away in revulsion, her neck coated in heavy slime. Ray looks around and sees her sword, lying out of reach. She has just one rail-gun bolt left. Ladon has gone silent now, but she can almost feel a beam of bestial rage, like a heatwave, coming at her from his direction.</p>

<p>Ray hops to her feet and faces Ladon. The frog-man is unmoved, apparently waiting for her to recover before attacking. <em>How honorable</em>, Ray thinks. Or maybe he&#39;s just taking a moment to consider his revenge. Dark red blood dribbles down his chin and makes a streak down the front of his armor. His enormous, unblinking eyes are impossible to read, but Ray imagines he’s probably feeling grumpy.</p>

<p>She puts her fists up, pugilist-style. Again.</p>

<p>“Round 2!” she gleefully exclaims, to the sound of moans and shouts of frustration and anger from the soldiers. Ray grins, and though she is not feeling very confident about further fisticuffs with Mega-Frog, she tries to stay positive.</p>

<p>&quot;And this time, no tongues!&quot; Ray adds.</p>

<p>Ladon turns toward the soldiers, and belches in rage, silencing their protests. The entire throng backs up a step, widening the circle around the two combatants.</p>

<p>He turns back toward Ray. <em>“Mlump”</em>, he says, a glob of blood and frog-saliva spilling from his mouth. Ray is too terrified to think of anything clever and sarcastic to say in reply.</p>

<p><em>“Mlaaaaar!”</em> Ladon roars, the end a long, screaming, throaty sound, like a raving lunatic trying to sing opera while vomiting.</p>

<p><em>Can’t let him get close</em>, she thinks, <em>Have to find a way out of here.</em></p>

<p>Ray looks frantically around her, trying to spot any possibility of escape, struggling with rising panic. But the Empyrean soldiers are on all sides, very eagerly awaiting her brutal demise. She has nowhere to run.</p>

<p>Ray realizes now is probably the time to trigger the charges. She might not get another chance. If Ladon kills or captures her before she has a chance to set off the chain, the mission will be for nothing. She glances at her chronometer. </p>

<p><em>I can’t avoid him forever</em>, she thinks, <em>and at some point they’ll just get sick of this game and shoot me.</em></p>

<p>Ray puts her finger on the detonator trigger, ready to press it. She hesitates — doing this now is an admission that she might be about to lose a fight, and that’s not something Captain Ray Carter is comfortable with. </p>

<p>New plan: kill the giant frog first, <em>then</em> trigger the charges.</p>

<p>She’s gotten his helmet off, but she’s almost out of ammo and she’s lost her sword. It might be time to try the ghost-hand trick. Ray grimaces at the thought of sticking her hand, “magical” or otherwise, into that big, ugly, slimy head.</p>

<p><em>I’ll have to get close enough to kiss him</em>, she thinks. <em>I wonder if he’d turn into a giant prince…</em></p>

<p><em>Wouldn’t be worth it,</em> she decides.</p>

<h3>3</h3>

<p>As Ray imagines trying to squish a gargantuan frog brain in her hand while being struck repeatedly by a beachball filled with cement, a commotion erupts among the soldiers on the outside of the assembled crowd.</p>

<p>This commotion quickly elevates into screams, shouts, and the sounds of battle. The loud crack of gunpowder weapons cuts clearly over the clash of metal and the high whine of rail-gun fire. The Dominion soldiers are being attacked, and by the sound of it they are not faring well.</p>

<p><em>Orion!</em> Ray thinks. <em>I hope he knows he’s got a hell of a lot more than just Dominion grunts to handle over here.</em></p>

<p>Ray resists the urge to take her eyes off Ladon, who shows no sign of being distracted by the attack, his gigantic, glassy eyes still locked on her. </p>

<p>Ray is starting to take his behavior personally.</p>

<p>The screams and sounds of Dominion soldiers being slaughtered grows closer and louder, but still Ladon does not budge.</p>

<p>“Sounds like your friends could use some help,” Ray says, still not daring to take her eyes off him or move a step.</p>

<p>Ray sees Ladon slowly crouch, preparing to leap at her. She cannot believe he’s willing to let a regiment of troops get mowed down just to get revenge on her for lopping his tongue off. </p>

<p>She didn’t even cut the whole thing off, just the tip!</p>

<p>Ray, without a weapon other than her meta-form arm, stands with fists up, as ready as she’s going to get.</p>

<p>Just as it seems Ladon is about to pounce, he spins toward the gathered soldiers who have made a line and are attempting to hold it against whatever is advancing across the flight deck. This line breaks as Ladon turns, a flood of furious, blood-soaked beast-men pouring through the breach. Dozens are through in an instant, and many others begin clawing their way over the soldiers holding the line — which quickly falls as the Dominion forces disappear, screaming, beneath the frenzied mass of teeth, claws, fur and scales — a horde made up of every animal-human hybrid imaginable.</p>

<p><em>Well</em>, Ray thinks, <em>every </em>stupid<em> one.</em></p>

<p>The advancing beast-men flood toward Ladon in an eerily quiet wave. Except for the thump of their bodies against the deck, the scrape of their claws, and the heavy sounds of their grunting and breathing, they are utterly silent. The screams and cries of their Empyrean victims fill the air as they are torn apart by the relentless horde, but even when injured or killed the beast-men make no sound.</p>

<p>Ray watches as Ladon appears to brace himself for the onslaught. </p>

<p>Having torn the Dominion soldiers holding the line to shreds, the beast-men advance and swiftly overwhelm Ladon, who continues to swing his boulder-like fists, knocking beast-men through the air like toys, until he is lost under an oddly hushed, squirming mass of teeth, fur, claws and tentacles.</p>

<p>But still Ladon does not go down. Ray watches in horrified amazement as the writhing mountain of beast-men begins to move, Ladon dragging the entire horde along with him.</p>

<p>As amazing as it is, Ray knows she does not have time to spectate. The soldiers who were surrounding her have now all moved to engage the attacking force, and the way is more or less clear. She looks up, toward the bow of the ship, at the distant bridge towers standing out against the bright red glow of the Gyre’s halo. The bridge complex looks much further away from down here on the flight deck than it had from the catwalks. No time to waste.</p>

<p>She makes a very quick detour to snatch her sword off the deck, then turns toward the bridge and breaks into a sprint, taking swipes at Dominion soldiers here and there as she goes, managing to remove two arms and one head on her way.</p>

<p>She checks her chronometer without breaking stride — eighteen minutes left.</p>

<p>At just this moment, a loud siren blares across the flight deck, cutting through the sounds of battle. As the siren’s wail fades, Ray hears the thunderous stomping of an advancing force, and sees two regiments of Dominion soldiers approaching rapidly across the deck, toward the on-going battle — almost directly in Ray’s path. </p>

<p><em>Reinforcements!</em></p>

<p>Behind her, the beast-man army appears to have finished pulverizing and eviscerating the first regiment, and has begun to flood across the flight deck toward the newly arriving troops. The carnage in their wake — a veritable landscape of Empyrean blood and guts — makes even Ray feel a bit queasy.</p>

<p>As the two opposing forces advance, Ray realizes she will be caught directly between them — not a desirable position to be in. On one side, she faces the brutal Dominion forces, bristling with rail-guns and swords. On the other, a ferocious, seething mass of savage, bloodthirsty man-animal hybrids, any one of which would tear her apart in an instant, without Orion to control them.</p>

<p>Ray knows her biggest concern is that, any moment now, the Dominion forces will be within range to fire on the mass of beast-men — she is about to be caught in very heavy crossfire. She looks toward the bridge complex, which doesn’t appear much closer. Ray knows she won’t be able to clear the advancing line of Dominion soldiers before they open fire.</p>

<p>The entire front line of beast-men is about to get mowed down like grass, and Ray with them.</p>

<p>Ray turns, and runs directly into the oncoming tidal wave of beast-men.</p>

<h3>4</h3>

<p>As she gets closer she sees what a nightmarish mob it is — every kind of weird hybrid, no two alike — fur, scales, horns, antlers and tentacles of all kinds. And everything dripping in Empyrean gore. Many of the beast-men are suffering from grievous injuries themselves, some even missing limbs, or partially disemboweled — yet still they advance in a ferocious charge, like a ravenous zombie horde.</p>

<p><em>But they’re alive</em>, Ray thinks. <em>And Orion doesn’t appear to have any qualms about sacrificing them</em>, Ray thinks, <em>I wonder how he justifies that one</em>. Ray decides to ask him when she gets a chance. But for now, she’s just going to take advantage of the cannon fodder, and let Orion deal with all the ethical and philosophical issues.</p>

<p>She hits the line, ready to swing if she faces any resistance, but the swarm parts around her, like she’s Moses and they’re the Red Sea. A few of the jumpier ones — kangaroo-men, flea-men, grasshopper-men, and the like — leap over her head without missing a beat. Surrounded by them now, Ray is again struck by their bizarre silence. </p>

<p>As she enters the throng, the high-pitched report of Empyrean rail-gun fire erupts over the sounds of the scrabbling horde. It is the beast-men’s turn to be slaughtered.</p>

<p>Though Ray charges through the throng at full speed, the flood of beast-men seems unending. The Dominion forces are clearly gaining ground, however — Ray hears the rail-gun blasts growing closer, and the beast-men around her start to fall, taken down by plasma bolts that tear them apart.</p>

<p>Seconds later, she is through the beast-man mob, and onto the battlefield left in its wake, a truly gruesome sight.</p>

<p>Several skirmishes continue across the flight deck here, but most of the area is devoid of the living. The deck is covered in blood and gore, both of beast-men and Empyreans, all appearing black in the starlight. Corpses are strewn about, by the dozens, almost all of them Empyreans who have been dismembered, disemboweled, slaughtered in the most brutal and vicious ways possible.</p>

<p>Ray, a great lover of violence, but not a huge fan of blood and guts, is horrified as well as fascinated by the scene. She watches Orion slowly picking his way through the aftermath of the battle, using his pistols to finish off wounded survivors, from both sides of the battle. He is completely covered in Empyrean gore, his gray hair a wild, tangled mass over a black mask of blood. His eyes are the only visible feature of his face, staring ever forward as he continues his slow, relentless advance through the aftermath, wielding his pistols, <em>Justice</em> and <em>Mercy</em>, like the swords of a dervish. </p>

<hr />

<p>&quot;Wait, you have names for your guns? Is that some kind of a religious thing?” Ray had once asked Orion with a laugh that was a bit more derisive than she had meant it to be … a bit. </p>

<p>At the time she had known very little about him, other than that he was some kind of <em>Buddhist</em> vegetarian. With guns that had names.</p>

<p>“Religious? No, it’s a personal choice. I call them <em>Justice</em> and <em>Mercy</em>,” Orion had replied.</p>

<p>“Jesus and Mary?” Ray had asked with a grin.</p>

<p>“Uh … <em>Justice</em> and <em>Mercy</em>,” Orion had corrected, humorlessly.</p>

<p>“Okay. So … is that so they know which one you’re talking to?” Ray had asked him.</p>

<p>“Umm, no. I … find it helps to remind me, at times, why I do what I do,” Orion had responded, apparently unfazed by Ray’s baiting.</p>

<p>“You mean, why you shoot people?” Ray had said, flatly.</p>

<p>&quot;To put it as bluntly as possible, yes,” Orion had seemed uncomfortable with this.</p>

<p><em>Getting close to a nerve</em>, Ray had thought.</p>

<p>“I try not to overthink it, myself,” she had said to him. He had not responded.</p>

<p>“So which is which?” Ray had asked, gesturing to the two heavy pistols hanging from Orion’s belt.</p>

<p>“They are identical weapons, but <em>Justice</em> I keep loaded with rubber, non-lethal, rounds. The other, <em>Mercy</em>, is loaded with standard rounds.”</p>

<p>“Wait, you call the one with the <em>rubber</em> bullets ‘Justice’? Seems like that would be ‘Mercy’ … aren’t you being merciful by <em>not</em> killing somebody?”</p>

<p>“Is wounding more merciful than killing?” Orion had asked her.</p>

<p>“Well, of course!” Ray had laughed, and looked at the man as if he were mad.</p>

<p>&quot;So, your feeling is that the deadly weapon should be &#39;Justice&#39;&quot;?</p>

<p>“Doesn’t that make more sense?” Ray had asked him, still smiling.</p>

<p>“How is killing just, if it isn’t mercy?” he had asked her.</p>

<p>Ray had been at a momentary loss for words. <em>Was this guy for real?</em></p>

<p>“Uh … because some people <em>deserve</em> to die?”</p>

<p>“Who?”</p>

<p>“This is getting too deep for me. I was just trying to have a conversation,” Ray had said, shaking her head.</p>

<p>“About death.”</p>

<p>“About your guns!”</p>

<p>“Exactly.”</p>

<hr />

<p>It was at that time that Ray had first begun to doubt Orion’s mental competence, not to mention his general allure. Since then she’s had ample opportunity to see that Orion is, in fact, completely crazy—</p>

<p><em>Like a fox!</em> thinks Ray, watching now as Orion, without turning around to look, puts a bullet between the eyes of an Empyrean who is attempting to sneak up behind him. The Empyrean’s head is blown apart by the high-caliber round.</p>

<p><em>Looks like the Dominion boys are getting a little taste of </em>Mercy<em> tonight</em>.</p>

<h3>5</h3>

<p>As Ray watches Orion navigate the battlefield, never turning his head, never missing a shot, she realizes that he can see through the beast-men’s eyes. Apparently, all of them at once.</p>

<p><em>Neat trick ... but what a horror show — this slaughter from a hundred different angles? No wonder the guy’s fucking nuts.</em> But it doesn’t seem to be bothering Orion any, although the strain of controlling so many minds at once is clearly taking its toll, his face a grim, fixed mask of black blood and sweat, his eyes never straying from a point in the air before him, even as he strides forward, following the advancing horde.</p>

<p><em>But, aren’t </em>Buddhists<em> pacifists?</em> she wonders. <em>Well .. he is committing an extremely violent slaughter about every five seconds at the moment!</em></p>

<p>Perhaps zombie-brained aliens aren’t protected by his religion.</p>

<p>But what about the &quot;beast-men&quot;?</p>

<p>Weren’t they “properly” alive? And yet Orion appeared to be using them exactly as if they were weapons, or armor, to be beaten against the enemy until broken, and then replaced. And in the aftermath of the battlefield he treated the wounded of his own forces with no more regard than he did the wounded enemy — killing Empyrean and beast-man alike with a single shot from <em>“Mercy”</em>.</p>

<p>Orion professed pacifism, and yet embraced violence with such gusto that it was disturbing even to Ray to witness the man in a fight. Nick, himself no slouch when it came to busting heads, was horrified by Orion’s savagery, often refusing to fight alongside him.</p>

<p>But the man carried a gun with rubber bullets. Not that she’d ever seen him use it — Orion seemed to mete out a whole lot of “mercy”, but not much “justice”. She had once asked him about this apparent contradiction.</p>

<p>“My love of violence is not an endorsement of it,” he had told her.</p>

<p><em>What a complicated way to relieve a guilty conscience</em>, Ray thinks. Clearly, the guy needs a shrink.</p>

<p>Ray avoids drawing any attention to herself — including Orion’s — as she works her way across the grisly battlefield toward the open deck and the bridge beyond. She tries to avert her eyes from the mostly-unidentifiable chunks and pieces of various alien anatomies littering her way.</p>

<p><em>All these juicy Empyrean corpses ...</em> she thinks, <em>but nobody died!</em></p>

<h3>6</h3>

<p>Ray sees a lone Dominion grunt, apparently the last man standing in his unit, staggering around as if in shock (<em>zombie shock</em>), rail-gun hanging loose in one hand and about to drop. The man stares at the chaos around him, frantically searching for any sign of allies.</p>

<p><em>He looks like he could use some mercy</em>, Ray thinks, and slightly deviates from her path to intercept him, betting his pistol is empty.</p>

<p>When the man sees her, he immediately raises his weapon, a look of somewhat puzzled surprise on his face. Ray does not slow her advance, and draws her sword as she nears the soldier. The soldier pulls the trigger on his rail-gun rapidly several times, but the weapon is empty, as Ray had guessed.</p>

<p>Just as Ray is about to raise her sword to lop the grunt’s head off as she jogs by, the body of a beast-man comes from out of nowhere and lands directly on the man, clinging to him with multiple long, thin arms. The beast-man’s torso is roughly cylindrical in shape, covered with a brown, crusty shell. The creature holds the soldier tightly in an embrace of tangled stick arms, as the soldier screams and attempts to bat the massive bug-like creature away from him. The creature tears off the soldier’s helmet and vomits a green-yellow goo into the man’s exposed face.</p>

<p><em>It’s a fucking stick-bug!</em>, Ray thinks. The soldier’s screams are deafening, his face a mass of molten flesh — the stick-bug–man has already buzzed away, off to find its next victim. Ray runs by without slowing her pace.</p>

<p><em>Acid spit! Nasty ... but effective!</em> Ray thinks.</p>

<p>A few seconds later, Ray passes close to a Dominion officer with his foot on the neck of a fallen beast-man, ready to run it through. The beast-man struggles hopelessly to free itself. Ray has a fraction of a moment to act — she hits the ground, dropping to the knees of her armored boots and sliding across the slick, blood-soaked surface of the flight deck, ramming the Empyrean from behind at full speed. The soldier tumbles off of the fallen beast-man, onto the deck. With inhuman swiftness, the beast-man leaps to its feet. Its round head is covered in short, coarse fur, matted with blood. From its cat-like mouth emerge the two most monstrous incisors Ray has ever seen.</p>

<p><em>A beaver</em>, Ray thinks, incredulous — and a bit annoyed.</p>

<p>The Dominion soldier, recovering somewhat from the surprise attack, reaches for his sidearm, when the frenzied beaver-man leaps on him, and tears the soldier’s throat out with its enormous teeth, nearly decapitating the man with a single, ferocious bite.</p>

<p><em>Whoa. Okay, the teeth make sense</em>, Ray admits. Maybe there was something to this weird animal thing after all. </p>

<p>But still, she wouldn’t mind seeing a pack of dashing wolf-men chasing down a Dominion grunt, or maybe a lion-man dramatically tearing someone apart with his ferocious claws while letting out a mighty roar, golden mane flowing.</p>

<hr />

<p>&quot;Are all the Empyrean ‘slave’ races beast-people?&quot; Ray had once asked Nick.</p>

<p>“Beast-men, they call them. Yeah.”</p>

<p>“Of course they do. Are they all Earth animals?&quot;</p>

<p>“Yeah.”</p>

<p>&quot;Why the hell is that?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No idea,” Nick had admitted.</p>

<p>&quot;And why are they all weird animals?&quot; Ray asked.</p>

<p>&quot;Weird?&quot; Nick had said, as if he really hadn’t known what she was getting at.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, you know, like turtles and chickens. Why aren&#39;t they cooler animals, like bears and wolves and so forth?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don&#39;t know, kid, why don&#39;t you ask the next chicken-man we come across why he didn’t evolve from a cooler animal?&quot;</p>

<p>Ray had snorted at this, but had been momentarily sidetracked by memories of the ferocious and brutal “cock-men” they had recently encountered — an encounter they had narrowly survived.</p>

<p>&quot;Turtle and chicken people. Okay. What&#39;s next? Mosquito-men?&quot; Ray had asked.</p>

<p>“There’s a race of snail people that live on a moon of Saturn,” Orion had offered.</p>

<p>&quot;Bullshit!”</p>

<p>&quot;It&#39;s true. Brilliant architects and scientists,” Nick had confirmed.</p>

<p>&quot;Snail-men,” Ray had been incredulous.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.”</p>

<p>&quot;Do they have shells?&quot;</p>

<p>“Uh … No,” Nick had answered.</p>

<p>&quot;Then why aren&#39;t they &#39;slug-men&#39;?&quot; Ray had demanded.</p>

<p>“Maybe they evolved out of their shells, like we did with our tails,” Nick had answered with a sigh, “Or maybe they have a little tiny shell somewhere, I don&#39;t know, I&#39;ve never seen one naked. I kinda hope I never do, honestly. Let’s just say they don’t exactly conform to human standards of beauty.”</p>

<p>&quot;None of this makes any sense anyway,“ Ray had said, throwing her hands up, ”but if it&#39;s not going to make sense at least it could be a cool mess instead of … well, getting brutalized by chicken men. I just didn’t expect the universe to be so … ridiculous.”</p>

<p>“Ridiculous it may be, but dangerous just the same,” Nick had noted. </p>

<p>&quot;Maybe the universe&#39;s idea of ‘cool’ isn&#39;t the same as yours, lass,” Orion had offered.</p>

<p>“Yeah,” Ray had glumly replied, “that&#39;s been clear to me for some time.”</p>

<h3>7</h3>

<p>The beaver-man, having dispatched its attacker, black gore dripping from its gaping, absurdly buck-toothed mouth, stands and looks directly at Ray. It speaks to her in Orion’s voice.</p>

<p>“Thank you!” it says, “But best get off the deck now, lass!”</p>

<p>Despite having been beat up, thrown around, strangled, and shot at, Ray still finds she has enough energy in reserve to get ticked off at the condescension. But before she can give a sufficiently sarcastic reply, the beaver-man is gone, leaping back into the bloody mass of violence, directly onto the back of an unfortunate Dominion soldier who is quickly overwhelmed and torn apart by a furious pack of beast-men.</p>

<p>Finally free of the battlefield, with nothing but the open flight deck before her, Ray starts jogging toward the bridge complex in the distance, Dominion boots stomping, Empyrean blood drying on her bare skin. Her rail-gun has just one shot left — but she has her sword, and she’s somehow managed to survive a fight with Mega-Frog, <em>and</em> being caught between half the Dominion army and a horde of beast-men, unscathed. Amazing.</p>

<p>Ray feels indestructible.</p>

<p>She checks the time. A little tight, but she can make it up. She decides to trigger the chain as soon as she hits the bridge complex. It should be plenty of time.</p>

<p>She glances down at herself, smeared with black blood, and decides that all this violence might have been a bit more satisfying if Empyrean blood were a proper red. Perhaps she would feel more like she’s been in a battle, and less like she’s been swimming in sewers. </p>

<p>Nick claims that original Solarians squirt appropriately vibrant gore — Ray hopes to meet some one day. According to the professor, this difference is due to the fact that Empyreans, though evolved from Solarians, are is so full of pollutants and toxins, because of the highly noxious nature of their technology, that their blood has turned black — but their immortal Solarian physiology makes it impossible for them to become ill or die from this. </p>

<p>Professor Y had warned the team to limit their exposure to Empyrean blood, as he feared it might be toxic to frail Earthlings. Ray, wearing little more than a bikini’s worth of shredded <em>United Space Force</em> jumpsuit, is essentially bathing in the stuff from head to toe.</p>

<p><em>Oh well,</em> Ray thinks, <em>maybe it’ll give me super powers</em>.</p>

<p>Ray comes upon the silent, empty hulks of the <em>Abuse’s</em> docked fighter force looming like sleeping dragons in the starlight. Only a hand-full of Dominion fighters have managed to launch, thanks to Orion and his beast-man army’s brutal sabotage of the flight deck. </p>

<p>She sprints openly now, trying to make up some time. Blood and sweat mix and run down her skin in sludgy black rivulets. Her legs are pounding from exertion. She keeps her eyes on the prize: holding Dr. Zed’s heart — well, <em>heart-thing</em> — in her hand.</p>

<p>Somewhere ahead, near the bridge, alarms start going off — a loud wailing sound Ray knows is the Dominion air-raid siren.</p>

<p><em>That would be Nick</em>, she thinks with a grin. </p>

<p>She hears sudden explosions, and stops to take a breath and watch as Nick descends on the <em>Abuse</em>, guns blazing. He has traded the rocket in for a void-cycle — a sort of single-seat space motorcycle — very maneuverable, very fast. Not as heavily armed as the rocket, but a great vehicle for harassing and pestering the enemy. Nick wears a space helmet to protect him from the void, as he flies in and out of the <em>Abuse’s</em> atmosphere, strafing the catwalks and upper decks repeatedly with the void-cycle’s rail-cannon.</p>

<p>Ray realizes Nick’s going to be pissed if he spots her out here, and she briefly considers staying out of sight before scolding herself for it. </p>

<p><em>Fuck ‘im</em>, she thinks, but she stays in the shadows of the closest Dominion fighter as she watches the show going on above her.</p>

<p>Nick easily evades several shots by the anti-spacecraft cannon mounted on the <em>Abuse</em>, but Ray sees several Dominion grunts frantically assembling a tripod-mounted rail-chain-gun on the upper catwalk. Ray hopes Nick sees this as well — the speed and accuracy of this weapon make it a significant threat. The soldiers work furiously to get the gun operational before Nick’s next pass over them.</p>

<p>Ray quickly realizes she has no reason to worry, however, as she sees Nick changing course to avoid flying by the now-assembled chain-gun. Instead of another fly-by, he turns his bike directly upward, gains some distance above the open catwalk, then dives straight back down onto it, coming at the soldiers from directly above — the one direction the gun cannot be aimed. Nick opens fire, destroying the mounted gun and scattering Empyrean bodies and body parts.</p>

<p><em>Thousands of years in space, and they’re still shit at thinking in three dimensions</em>, she muses.</p>

<p>Ray realizes that Nick has not pulled away, but continues his mad dive.</p>

<p><em>He’s too close!</em> Ray thinks, watching Nick plunge back toward the deck, guns blazing. <em>Somthing’s wrong. He’s going to crash!</em></p>

<p>As Nick’s cycle seems certain to collide with the ship, Ray flinches instinctively, expecting an explosion. Instead, she sees Nick’s void-cycle has somehow flipped one-hundred-eighty degrees in the blink of an eye, and is jetting away from the deck at maximum thrust, blasting whatever might be left of the Empyrean soldiers with rocket exhaust.</p>

<p>It is the fanciest bit of flying Ray has ever seen. She decides the man might actually deserve his reputation as a pilot almost as much as his reputation as a womanizing pig.</p>

<p>Having vanquished his opponents, Nick pulls off his helmet to avail himself momentarily of the ship’s atmosphere, letting off some pressure of his own as he releases a long stream of vomit that trails his bike for several meters before dispersing in a gray-green mist.</p>

<p>Ray, herself a trained pilot, nods in sympathy. <em>It happens</em>.</p>

<h3>8</h3>

<p>Without further difficulty, Ray finally reaches the bridge complex.</p>

<p>She quickly locates a portal access to the lower levels, ripping the door open as she had done before. The access corridor revealed is better lit than in Engineering, and Ray descends with sword drawn, ready to face opposition.</p>

<p>The long corridor leads to the outer rooms of Dr. Zed’s medical labs. Ray’s heart begins to race as she grows closer to her goal. She has only vague, hazy memories of her last visit to this place, but they have been clear enough. She hopes to work through some of that trauma on this visit.</p>

<p>The outer labs are dark, the surgical tables empty, the surgical-bots silent and still. No sign of Dr. Zed here. Ray creeps through the shadows toward the access elevator on the other side of the room. It is wide enough to admit a gurney carrying a patient, as well as any attendees. A sudden memory of being wheeled into this elevator cuts through Ray’s mind like a silent scream.</p>

<p>Ray’s reverie is interrupted by a sudden rhythmic pounding, as if someone is hammering slowly on the bulkheads of the ship with a gigantic hammer. The sound continues to grow louder, approaching from back down the access corridor.</p>

<p><em>Don’t worry about it, Carter,</em> she tells herself, <em>just keep moving! Eyes on the prize!</em></p>

<p>But Ray is concerned about getting caught from behind — she wants to make sure she won’t be harassed while she’s busy with the doctor — so she creeps back to the corridor and peers down it, into the dim light, and listens carefully. Whatever it is, it’s definitely coming her way.</p>

<p>Suddenly, Ray sees movement — something huge is descending the stairs at the far end of the corridor — an almost unrecognizable mound of bloody armor and mangled frog-flesh.</p>

<p>“Oh my <em>god</em>,” Ray can’t stop herself from exclaiming.</p>

<p>Ladon looks like something a cat dragged in ... a very, very big cat. Most of his heavy armor is intact, which may explain his survival, but his face and head have been viciously mauled. One of his enormous eyeballs is missing completely, a gaping, bloody hole in its place. His face is a mass of lacerations and flayed, dangling skin. He is covered from head to toe in bright red beast-man blood.</p>

<h3>9</h3>

<p>“You don’t look so good,” Ray tells him.</p>

<p>Ladon manages to croak an unintelligible reply between rattling-vomit sounds, as he continues to stagger down the corridor toward her.</p>

<p>“Look, you’ve clearly had enough for today, why don’t we just call it quits for now? I’ll go do what I need to do, you go back to your ... lily pad, or whatever, and get rested up, and we’ll finish this another time. What do you say?”</p>

<p>Ladon does not slow his lumbering, staggering, relentless advance. Ray stands with her hands on her hips, watching the mutilated giant all but drag himself toward her, at about half the speed she could walk away.</p>

<p>“You are determined, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>Suddenly, Ladon stops his advance. Even though Ray is anticipating it, she barely has a chance to react as the creature’s lips part, and the thick, pink tongue shoots out, lightning-fast, toward her. Ray has just enough time to put her hand on her sword hilt, when the approaching appendage snaps to a stop, about a meter short, directly in front of her. The jagged, swollen wound on the stump sprays blood directly into Ray’s face.</p>

<p>Ladon roars in pain and rage. The tongue collapses, flaccid, and slowly retreats, dragging across the floor toward Ladon’s mouth, leaving a long trail of blood. </p>

<p>Ray watches this spectacle with absolute horror and revulsion, wiping frog-tongue–blood out of her eyes.</p>

<p>The beast-man grows impatient while attempting to draw his tongue back in, and resorts to using his armored hands to reel it in, gathering tangled, bloody wads of the fleshy thing up and shoving them back into his badly mutilated mouth.</p>

<p><em>Alright, enough is enough,</em> Ray thinks, and draws her rail-gun.</p>

<p><em>Gonna be hard to miss that noggin</em>, she thinks.</p>

<p>Ladon stops his lumbering advance, freezing in place at the sight of the pistol aimed at him. He grabs something off the belt of his armor — a spherical device, not a pistol, but clearly a weapon of some kind.</p>

<p><em>A grenade</em>, Ray thinks in shock, <em>stupid frog!</em>.</p>

<p>“You set that off in here we’re <em>both</em> dead,” Ray tells him.</p>

<p>Ray has often wondered what she’d do in a stand-off. She always thought she’d just pull the trigger and get it all over with, why stand around and let the other guy make the decisions? But now, she’s surprised to find how tempting it is to hold on one more second — just to see what your opponent is capable of. The thrill is almost too much for her — she pulls the trigger.</p>

<p>Her shot isn’t perfect, and strays a bit to the right, catching the beast-man on the left side of his face, removing most of the face and head on that side. Over half of the creature’s brain is liquified — blood, spinal fluid, and tissue exploding outward.</p>

<p>At the same time, Ladon’s weapon produces a beam of concentric circles of energy, like yellow smoke rings, that radiate outward. Luckily, Ladon is slightly too far away, and Ray is only grazed by the outer waves of the beam. This is still enough to have an impact, however. Ray hears a sharp pop at her right ear, and her meta-form arm suddenly disappears completely. The rail-gun falls to the floor with a clatter.</p>

<p><em>EMP grenade!</em> she thinks, horrified. She focuses intently, trying to bring her arm back ... nothing.</p>

<p>Ray looks up at Ladon. The giant creature is collapsed in a massive, bloody heap in the corridor, a growing pool of gore around him three meters wide.</p>

<p>Over half his head is gone, his jaw is missing completely. Ray’s shot also removed his remaining eye, and he has lost enough blood to drown a horse in — but still Ladon lives. Ray watches him struggle to find his feet, slip in his own blood, collapse for a moment, and try again.</p>

<p>The thing wouldn’t stop. It <em>couldn’t</em> stop.</p>

<p><em>Someone built this thing to keep coming, no matter what,</em> Ray realizes.</p>

<p><em>Half his fucking brain is gone and he can still walk — he’s like a living zombie (the proper kind of zombie).</em> Ray doesn’t almost feel sorry for the thing. At all. She debates going over and finishing him off, but quickly decides getting anywhere near it is a very bad idea.</p>

<p>With bemused horror, Ray watches the giant, bloody, mostly-headless frog-man struggle to stand. <em>At some point he’ll just run out of blood, won’t he?</em> she wonders.</p>

<p>She tries to check out the metaform emitter ring on the stump of her arm, but it’s too close to her shoulder to get a good look, and try as she might, she cannot get it to respond to her mental commands.</p>

<p>“Fuck,” she says. She’s going to have to make do with one feeble, pink little human arm. For now.</p>

<h3>10</h3>

<p>Ray glances at her chronometer. The tiny screen is completely black, also fried by the EMP pulse. She has no way of knowing how much time is left before she misses her ride — and she cannot trigger the explosions to send the <em>Abuse</em> to it’s destiny. She curses herself for not sticking to the plan.</p>

<p>“Double fuck.”</p>

<p><em>Well, it’s up to Nick or Orion now,</em> she thinks. <em>They better be prepared to—</em></p>

<p>Ray’s thought is interrupted by a massive explosion from somewhere astern that shakes the corridor and echoes like thunder through the structure around her. Ladon, blind and most likely deaf, clearly feels the detonation himself, and stops flailing for a moment. </p>

<p><em>That was definitely the first charge,</em> Ray thinks. Someone else has triggered the detonations.</p>

<p><em>I guess they were prepared! Thanks for the vote of confidence, guys!</em> Ray thinks. But despite the bitter twinge, she feels enormous relief that they hadn’t let her ruin the mission.</p>

<p>Ray realizes this means she’s free from her responsibilities to the team, nothing left now but to take care of her little personal errand. It also means she has at most twenty minutes before she’s stuck on a sinking ship.</p>

<p>Ray feels the tickle at her ankle a moment too late. She looks down, sees the wet pink thing stretched out toward her from the ruin of Ladon’s neck, and cries out in shock and horror. She tries to pull her leg away, but the stump of Ladon’s tongue, driven by impulses of hunger as strong as Ray’s impulse to survive, wraps around her ankle with an iron grip. </p>

<p>“No <em>fucking</em> way!” she cries.</p>

<p>The powerful muscle yanks her off her feet.</p>

<p>Armed with a sword but no sword arm, Ray curses herself for getting caught off guard. She tries to pull her leg free of the massive tongue, tries to pry it off with her fingers, but it is locked with a grip like a python’s. It continues to reel Ray in, as relentless as it is mindless.</p>

<p>She looks at the mostly headless body, its neck a mess of jagged flesh and bone. Flailing blindly, and struggling to keep its feet despite the slick pool of gore it continues to spout, Ladon’s body somehow drags itself into a standing position, thick arms braced against either wall of the corridor. Too weak to take a step forward, the creature continues to slowly reel Ray in by the leg with its powerful tongue.</p>

<p><em>For God’s sake! How do you </em>stop<em> it?</em> she thinks in panic.</p>

<p>Ray’s not sure what the thing intends to do with her once it gets her over there — the jaw is gone, so it won’t be able to eat her. </p>

<p><em>I guess it’ll just drown me in its own blood</em>, she thinks.</p>

<p>With some difficulty, she manages to draw the heavy Dominion sword from its scabbard with her left hand. It feels clumsy and awkward in her flesh-and-blood hand.</p>

<p>She tries to lift the great sword high enough to bring it down with force on the glistening pink appendage that grips her leg, but her left arm does not have the strength, and she cannot pierce or cut the thick, fibrous muscle.</p>

<p><em>Well</em>, she thinks, <em>I guess it’s just going to try to swallow me whole.</em></p>

<p>She looks at the dark hole of Ladon’s open gullet, surrounded by the remnants of the monster’s head. She’s pretty sure she won’t fit in there, but she’s definitely sure she does not want to find out.</p>

<p>Ray re-sheaths her sword and struggles to her feet, closing the distance between herself and Ladon to create slack in the monster’s tongue. Before it has a chance to pull her off her feet again, and before whatever senses are left to the mutilated beast-man detect her intentions, Ray leaps up the front of the enormous creature, clinging with one hand to the ragged edge of his torn armor at the neck, and pulls herself up. </p>

<p>Before Ray can scramble high enough to throw her right leg over Ladon’s shoulder, the two massive arms suddenly snap shut, catching her in a devastating bear-hug that immediately squeezes the breath out of her. The force is incredible — she feels as if her head will explode and every organ in her body is being crushed — even her heart is fighting to beat against the tremendous pressure.</p>

<p>If Ladon had not been severely weakened by the loss of so much blood — and most of a head — no doubt she would have been instantly killed. As it is, she can feel the beast-man’s strength slowly ebbing, but his bear-hug is still strong enough that Ray cannot draw breath. Darkness begins to creep into the edges of her vision, and Ray can feel herself losing consciousness.</p>

<p>Almost instinctively, Ray struggles to free her arm. She is surprised to find she is able to move it, due to Ladon’s weakness, and the fact that Ray is still coated in several slick layers of blood. As Ray fights pain and encroaching darkness to pull her arm free, she feels the hilt of her sword against her hand. She grabs the grip, and with a tremendous effort, and on the very edge of losing consciousness, she manages to wrench her left arm, sword in hand, from the monstrous bear-hug.</p>

<p>With her arm free, Ray has an instant to draw a painful breath before Ladon’s body squeezes her even more powerfully. Something in her back snaps, and Ray feels a horrific, stabbing pain there. With all her remaining strength, she pulls herself as far up in Ladon’s embrace as she can, and places the point of the heavy sword against the gaping, gurgling hole the giant tongue is still relentlessly trying to drag her into.</p>

<p>&quot;Maybe you can live without a brain, but let’s see how you do with no heart!&quot; she says. Putting all her weight over the heavy blade, she plunges it downward through the beast’s sucking, flapping gullet — stabbing deep into the massive torso, piercing Ladon’s heart.</p>

<p>The blood pumping from the gaping neck wound quickly abates, then stops completely. The giant body of the creature drops suddenly into a sitting position, then slides slowly back against the corridor wall, dragging Ray, leashed to the carcass by the giant muscular tongue, along with it. The last gouts of Ladon’s blood pour over her as she struggles to free herself, the pain like a knife being twisted in her spine. </p>

<p>As the tongue loses strength, Ray is finally able to cast it off and try to scramble to her feet. The stabbing pain in her back is so great she fails on her first attempt to stand. Ray grits her teeth against the pain and finally manages to gain her feet, standing atop Ladon’s gigantic carcass like a triumphant, if sorely tested, hunter.</p>

<h3>11</h3>

<p>She crouches and slides down, off the bloody armored carcass.</p>

<p>Once her feet are on the floor, Ray finds she cannot stand fully erect, the pain in her spine is crippling, and she fears her back has been broken. Despite the stabbing pain, she does her best to wipe Ladon’s blood and gore from her body with her left hand. She spits the frog-man’s blood from her mouth, wipes it from her eyes, strips it from her hair.</p>

<p>Grunting in pain and effort, Ray reaches down and grabs her rail-gun off the floor and awkwardly holsters it with her left hand. Retrieving her sword presents too much of a challenge for her, and she decides to leave it, protruding from Ladon’s ragged neck-hole like some grisly sword-in-the-stone.</p>

<p><em>A memento</em>, she thinks, eyeing the gruesome scene.</p>

<p>She’s lost her sword, can’t get her magic arm to work, and likely has a fractured spine and broken ribs.</p>

<p>Ray tries to take a deep breath and a sharp, searing pain cuts through her side — she cries out in pain, coughs, and tastes fresh blood in her mouth. A punctured lung. She still has her left arm and the rail-gun, but she knows her aim with her left hand is shit. Maybe she could hit someone with a feeble left-hook if they they get too close, and hold still.</p>

<p><em>Why the hell don’t I just walk away sometimes?</em> Ray thinks. But she has no ready answer, and as the second explosion thunders through the <em>Abuse</em>, she decides it’s best to leave the self-analysis for another time. She drags herself painfully back down the corridor in search of the mad Dr. Zed — she’s not about to let a little broken back interrupt her plans.</p>
